<h1> Endure Your Night of Darkness </h1>
<br>
<p><i>For His anger is fleeting, but His favor lasts a lifetime. Weeping may stay the night, 
    but joy comes in the morning</i>
<br>
Psalms 30:5
    <br>
    <br>
    With much weeping will come much rejoicing. That night may not be over in 12 hours,
    or even 12 months. The night speaks of darkness whereas the morning speaks of light.
    <br> 
    <br>
    <i>For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night or to the darkness."</i> 
    <br>
    1 Thessalonians 5:4
    <br>
    <br>
    Weeping may endure for a period of darkness in your life, but light comes, with great rejoicing. We have to need God. 
    If you never went through it, you wouldn't need Him. He has to be God, and for Him to be God you cannot be God. Israel
     went through hundereds of years of darkness before the deliverance from Egypt came, and they rejoiced. David went through
      it before he became king. In 2 Chronicles 15 we see that there was no peace in the land, nation was destroyed by nation,
       and city by city, and God troubled them with adversity on every side, but there was repentance, a return to seeking God
        with everything, all Judah rejoiced and God gave them rest. We see many times in Jeremiah he gets discouraged, he
        doesn't want to go on, he gets fed up, but God gives him the strength to keep going. Jesus had a Gethsemane before He
         brought victory. Nothing in life is easy, but when we go through hard times, it gets a little easier to go through them.
          When you go through it, you become willing to part ways with something which you should have already parted with, you
           change, you can become more humble, or more puffed up, it can make you more obedient, or complain more. But when you
            are wrestling with God and you come to a place where it doesn't matter if you have a following, or have "X" then God
             is pleased with His work in you.

    <i>Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will arise; though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.</i>
    <br>
    Micah 7:8
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>Light dawns in the darkness for the upright— for the gracious, compassionate, and righteous.</i>
    <br>
    Psalms 112:4
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>Blessed are those whose strength is in You, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. as they pass through the Valley of Baca,
     they make it a place of springs; even the autumn rain covers it with pools. they go from strength to strength, until each 
     ppears before God in Zion.</i>
     <br>
    Psalms 84:5-7
    <br>
    <br>
    The valley of Baca could refer to a valley of weeping. We all have to go through it at some stage. If you aren't going through
     it give it time, hard times will come. But if you allow God to bring you through it and understand what He is calling you to do,
      He will bring you from strength to strength. The key is not what do I need to do? You need to do absolutely nothing more than
       mandatory. You need to work a job etc, but in your spare time, do nothing. Just sit in silence alone, have a Bible with you,
    and talk to God, then let Him speak to you, guide you, and direct you through His word.  
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>He gives power to the faint and increases the strength of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and 
    fall. But those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles; they will run and 
    not grow weary, they will walk and not faint.</i>
    <br>
    Isaiah 40:29-31
    <br>
    <br>
    Behold the face of Christ, set your mind on Him. It is the thing you set your heart and mind on which you will become like.
     Those who make idols become like them, as do those who trust in them (Psalm 115) Those who set their heart and mind on the
      world become like the world. This is a dire warning, but with every negative there is a positive. It isn't a principle to
       be loathed, if it is Gods principle it should be loved. The posoitive is that if you set your heart and mind on Christ,
        you will become like Him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart. But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
    Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as 
    in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the
    Lord.</i> 
    <br>
    2 Corinthians 3:15-18
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>Therefore I urge you, brothers, on account of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, 
    which is your spiritual service of worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
     Then you will be able to test and approve what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.</i>
     <br>
    Romans 12:1-2
    <br>
    <br>
    This word for transformed is only used here twice and the other two times it is when Jesus was being "transfigured" on the mount.
    In other words, you must be transfigured by the renewing of your mind. When you renew your mind in prayer, the Bible, and Biblical
     things, you are able to test "X" against the standard. The more you renew your mind the more you will know if something passes the
      test. Notice how it says "renew" Because even the best of them need a renewal. Nobody gets a holy mind and is set for life, the
    holiest mind needs to be renewed daily. God will give you time for a while, you have a busy life. But if gone unchallanged, the old
     man will take over.
