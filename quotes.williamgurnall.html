        It is not the sharpness of the sword which kills, but the force 
        with which it is plunged in. Thus the hypocrite can lay his sword
         so gently against sin in his own heart that it never feels a thing.

        Now if the gospel will not allow us to pay our enemies back in their
         own coin, returning anger for anger, then certainly it forbids a brother 
         to spit fire into the face of another brother

Just as sincerity covers all defects hypocrisy uncovers the soul and strips it naked 
before God despite the richest embroidery of other qualities. This scab grows on even 
the sweetest perfections and changes a person's complexion in Gods eye more drastically
 than leporsy destroys the fairest face

Yet it is said of Amaziah, 'he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not
 with a perfect heart' (2 chron 25:2) His actions were good but his attitude was faulty -
  and this turned his right into a wrong. Thus we see how Asas uprightness supported him 
  in the midst of many shortcomings, but hypocrisy condemned Amaziah as he did what was right

Every time you pray to God in the name of Jesus, you are sure to receive answer. But how can you 
in faith use Christs name as the power to unlock the Father's heart, when at the same time that
 great name has so little sway with you to move you to obedience for His sake

Saints who live in strife and contention are sinning against the strong prayers which Christ Himself 
uttered on their behalf
