    <h1>Amazing grace</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
        <br>
        That saved a wretch; like me!
        <br>
      I once was lost, but now am found,
      <br>
        Was blind, but now I see.
        <br>
        <br>
        ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
        <br>
        And grace my fears relieved;
        <br>
      How precious did that grace appear
      <br>
        The hour I first believed!
        <br>
        <br>
        The Lord hath promised good to me,
        <br>
  His word my hope secures;
  <br>
He will my shield and portion be
<br>
  As long as life endures.
  <br>
  <br>
  When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
  <br>
  Bright shining as the sun,
  <br>
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
<br>
  Than when we first begun.
