        The puritans lived in the 16th and 17th century. They looked at the church of England and believed
        it still needed to be purified of some Roman Catholic practices. They lived in the time of the 
        protestant reformation, but they believed it hadn't gone far enough, that more reform was needed.
        Queen Elizabeth I wanted them to conform to the entirety of the book of common prayer.
        Some of them conformed completely and stayed in the church of England, many of them partially 
        conformed and went to jail for not conforming, whilst others left the church of England. In 1662, 
        2000 puritans lost their pulpit in the church of England for not conforming. 
        The puritans went through many afflictions. The average puritan had 9 children and lost 4-5 before
        they reached adulthood.
