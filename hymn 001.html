    <h1>My goal is God Himself</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    My goal is God Himself, not joy, nor peace,
    <br>
    Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God;
    <br>
    ’Tis His to lead me there—not mine, but His—
    <br>
    At any cost, dear Lord, by any road.
    <br>
    <br>
    So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,
    <br>
    And love can trust her Lord to lead her there;
    <br>
    Upheld by Him, my soul is following hard
    <br>
    Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer.
    <br>
    <br>
    No matter if the way be sometimes dark,
    <br>
    No matter though the cost be oft-times great,
    <br>
    He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark,
    <br>
    The way that leads to Him must needs be strait.
    <br>
    <br>
    One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay;
    <br>
    One thing I do, I press towards my Lord;
    <br>
    My God my glory here, from day to day,
    <br>
    And in the glory there my great Reward.
