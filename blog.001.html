<h1> The Presence of God </h1>
<br>
<p>The Bible is God speaking to us, and He says that we must hear His voice and enter into His rest.
     God told Moses "My presence will go with you and I will give you rest" Moses knew the danger 
     of prospering without the presence of God. But we see in Luke 14 that many were making excuses,
     and it was the religious people. Whilst there are some who believe it is just the Jews who
     will not taste of the supper, if they cannot see passed such a presupposition, unable to examine their
        own heart, they are the ones who will not taste of the supper. Because it was the religious, 
        the seemingly pious and righteous who would not taste of it. Whilst they made excuses in order
         that they might eat, drink, buy, sell, plant, and build. The very things which were done in 
         the days of Noah and Lot, these people believed to be right with God. It was actually the ones
          who these people deemed as worthless and outcasts who would taste of that supper, the poor, 
          the lame, the , the prostitutes, the sinners. When referring to the "righteous" He says "do 
          not ask your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbours" Think about what 
          that could mean to you and me today. They deemed those excuses of greater importance than 
          the presence of God, something was more important than the presence of God. Whatever we call
           them, God calls them excuses. Think about what it means to say I have bought an oxen, I have
            bought a piece of land, I have married a wife, and what are we saying today? What is hindering
             Gods presence? What are we placing before it? What are we prioritising over it? Is it serious?
              God said He was angry. God said they wouldn't taste of the supper. In repentance and rest you
               will be saved and in quietness and confidence will be your trust.

<i>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Depart and go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give it.’ 
And I will send My Angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a 
stiff-necked people.”</i>
<br>
Exodus 33:1-3
<br>
<br>
<i>Then Moses said to the Lord, “See, You say to me, ‘Bring up this people.’ But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet 
You have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found grace in My sight.’ 
Now therefore, I pray, if I have found grace in Your sight, show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I may find grace in
 Your sight. And consider that this nation is Your people.”
And He said, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
Then he said to Him, “If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here. 
For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found grace in Your sight, except You go with us? So we shall be separate,
 Your people and I, from all the people who are upon the face of the earth.”</i>
<br>
Exodus 33:12-16
<br>
<br>
<i>So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the places of honor, saying to them: 
Whenever you are invited by someone to a wedding celebration, do not sit down in the place of honor, lest one more honorable than you 
be invited by him; 
and he who invited you and him shall come and say to you, 'Give place to this man,' and then you begin with shame to take the last
place. 
But when you are invited, go and sit down in the last place, so that when he who invited you comes, he shall say to you, 
'Friend, go up higher.' Then you will have glory in the presence of those who recline with you. 
For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted." 
Then He also said to him who invited Him, "When you give a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends,
 nor your 
brothers, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid. 
But whenever you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; 
and you will be blessed, because they do not have anything to repay you; for it will be repaid to you 
in the resurrection of the just." 
Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, "Blessed is he
 who shall eat dinner in the kingdom of God!" 
Then He said to him, "A certain man gave a great dinner, and he invited many, 
and he sent his servant at dinnertime to say to those who were invited, 'Come, for all
 things are now ready.' 
But they all with one accord began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, 'I bought a field, and
 I must go and see it. I ask you, have me excused.' 
And another said, 'I bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you, have me excused.' 
Still another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.' 
So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, 
said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor 
and the maimed and the lame and the blind.' 
And the servant said, 'Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.' 
Then the master said to the servant, 'Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, 
so that my house may be filled. 
For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper.' "</i> 
<br>
Luke 14:7-24
<br>
<br>
<i>And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man. 
They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, until the
 day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 
Likewise also as it happened in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were
 buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building; 
but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. 
In the same way it shall be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</i>
<br>
Luke 17:26-30
<br>
<br>
<i>For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said: “By repentance and rest you would be saved;
 your strength would lie in quiet confidence—but you were not willing.”</i>
<br>
Isaiah 30:15
