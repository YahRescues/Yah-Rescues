   <p>In time of temptation, apprehensive consciences look so much to the present 
    trouble they are in that they need to be roused up to behold him in whom 
     may find rest for their distressed souls. In temptations it is safest to behold
      nothing but Christ the true brazen serpent, the true 'Lamb of God that taketh
       away the sin of the world'" 
       <br>
    Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 1</p>

    Gods people are bruised reeds before their conversion and oftentimes after. 
    Before conversion (except such as, being brought up in the church, God delighted
     to show himself gracious to from their childhood) are bruised reeds, yet in different
      degrees, as God sees fit. And as there are differences with regard to temperment,
       gifts and manner of life, so there are in Gods intention to use men in time to come;
        for usually he empties such of themselves, and makes them nothing, before he will use 
        them in any great services.
        <br>

The bruised reed is a man that for the most part is in some misery, as those were that came to
 Christ for help, any by misery he is brought to see sin as the cause of it, for, whatever pretences
  sin makes, they come to an end when we are bruised and broken
  <br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
This bruising is required before conversion that so the Spirit may make way for himself into the heart
 by levelling all proud, high thoughts, and that we may understand ourselves to be what indeed we are 
 by nature. We love to wander from ourselves and to be strangers at home, till God bruises us by one 
 cross or other and then we 'begin to think' and come home to ourselves with the prodigal
 <br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
After conversion we need bruising so that reeds may know themselves to be reeds, and not oaks. Even reed
 need bruising, by reason of the remainder of pride in our nature, and to let us see that we live by mercy.
  Such bruising may help weaker Christians not be too much discourages, when they see stronger ones shaken 
  and bruised. Thus, Peter was bruised when he wept bitterly (Matt. 26:75).

Physicians, though they put their patients to much pain, will not destroy nature, but raise it up by degrees.
 Surgeons will lance and cut, but not dismember. A mother who has a sick and self willed child will not 
 therefore cast it away. And shall there be more mercy in the stream than in the spring? Shall we think there 
 is more mercy in ourselves than in God, who plants the affection of mercy in us?

He never turned any back that came to him, though some went away of themselves
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
He shed tears for those who shed his blood, and now he makes intercession in heaven for weak Christians, standing 
between them and Gods anger
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
What should we learn from this but to 'come boldly to the throne of grace' (Heb 4:16) in all our grievances? Shall our
 sins discourage us when he appears there only for sinners? Are you bruised? Be of good comfort, he calls you. Conceal
  not your wounds, open all before him and take not Satans counsel. Go to Christ, although trembling, as the poor woman 
  who said 'If I may but touch his garment' (Matt 9:21)
  <br>

<br>
Christs way is first to wound, then to heal
