    A claim may go something like this:
    <br> 
    <br>
    "because the final 'god' in John 1:1 doesn't have the Greek definite article, 
    the word a may be supplied in translation"
    <br>
    <br>
    To somebody who doesn't know about definite articles or how they occur this might
    be convincing. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>What is a definite article?</h3>
    English has a definite article, it is the word "the" It represents definiteness. If you say
    you are going to have the apple, there is only one apple in questionn, but if you say you
    will have an apple then there are multiple apples in question. So the claim is that since
    John 1:1 doesn't have the word "the" then the word "God" isn't definite and cannot be
    referring to Almighty God.

    <br>
    <h3>Greek Words:</h3>
    θεός - God
    <br>
    ὁ    - Article
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>The Greek Article</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    The problem is that we are dealing with Greek, and not English. We can't apply English
    grammatical rules and force them to apply to Greek when they don't. English has more
    than one article and can easier distinguish between definiteness and indefiniteness,
    Greek has one article and it wouldn't be fair to say every time the article doesn't 
    appear there can be no definiteness. The Greek article is not "the Greek definite aricle"
    It doesn't have a definite article. It has an article which may or may not respresent
    definiteness. Its presence doesn't demand definiteness, its absence doesn't demand
    indefiniteness.
    <br>
    <br>
<h3>Applying the Logic</h3>
To accept the claim we would need to accept the idea that every time the word 'God' appears 
without the Greek article, it is not referring to Almighty God. If we applied this logic we
would onlt need to get to the 4th chapter before we had a discrepency
<br>
<br>
<h3>Matthew 4:4</h3>
ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ παντὶ ῥήματι ἐκπορευομένῳ διὰ <strong>στόματος θεοῦ</strong>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
The word for God looks different. Depending on how the word is being used, the ending
of the word appears differently. Here we can see that the word 'God' appears without 
the "definite article" but it clearly refers to Almighty God. The NWT used by Jehovah's 
Witnesses translates this word as Jehovah. If the logic is correct then they have 
incorrectly put Jehovah's name in the place of another god. Do the translators really
believe that the absence of the article demands indefiniteness? DO they believe that
'God' appearing without the article cannot be reffering to Almighty God? Matthew knew 
the passage in Hebrew, he will have known the passage used to tetragrammaton, and
he used 'God' without the article to refer to Almighty God. If it is good enough
for the apostles to refer to Almighty God without the Greek article, then is should
be good enough for us.
