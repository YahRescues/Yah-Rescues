    <h1>Olives that have known no pressure</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Olives that have known no pressure
        <br>
        No oil can bestow;
        <br>
        If the grapes escape the winepress,
        <br>
        Cheering wine can never flow;
        <br>
        Spikenard only through the crushing,
        <br>
        Fragrance can diffuse.
        <br>
        Shall I then, Lord, shrink from suff’ring
        <br>
        Which Thy love for me would choose?
        <br>
        Chorus
        <br>
        Each blow I suffer
        <br>
        Is true gain to me.
        <br>
        In the place of what Thou takest
        <br>
        Thou dost give Thyself to me
        <br>
        <br>
        Do my heart-strings need Thy stretching,
<br>
Songs divine to prove?
<br>
Do I need for sweetest music
<br>
Cruel treatment of Thy love?
<br>
Lord, I fear no deprivation
<br>
If it draws to Thee;
<br>
I would yield in full surrender
<br>
All Thy heart of love to see.
<br>
<br>
I’m ashamed, my Lord, for seeking
<br>
Self to guard alway;
<br>
Though Thy love has done its stripping,
<br>
Yet I’ve been compelled this way.
<br>
Lord, according to Thy pleasure
<br>
Fully work on me;
<br>
Heeding not my human feelings,
<br>
Only do what pleases Thee.
<br>
<br>
If Thy mind and mine should differ,
<br>
Still pursue Thy way;
<br>
If Thy pleasure means my sorrow,
<br>
Still my heart shall answer, “Yea!”
<br>
’Tis my deep desire to please Thee,
<br>
Though I suffer loss;
<br>
E’en though Thy delight and glory
<br>
Mean that I endure the cross.
<br>
<br>
Oh, I’ll praise Thee, e’en if weeping
<br>
Mingle with my song.
<br>
Thine increasing sweetness calls forth
<br>
Grateful praises all day long.
<br>
Thou hast made Thyself more precious
<br>
Than all else to me:
<br>
Thou increase and I decrease, Lord—
<br>
This is now my only plea.
